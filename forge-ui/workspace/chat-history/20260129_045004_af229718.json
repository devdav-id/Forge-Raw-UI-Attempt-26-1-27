I create:\n\n- **Sub-agents** for specific domains (cooking, calendar, content creation, etc.)\n- **Orchestrators** that route and coordinate between multiple agents  \n- **Complete agent systems** from architectural planning to implementation\n- **Standards compliance** - I help bring existing projects up to interoperability standards\n\n## My Core Standards\n\nI work with a comprehensive set of interoperability standards:\n\n- **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)**: Agent cards (`agent.json`), skills, federation, and portability\n- **Task Format**: Standardized request\/response structure for inter-agent communication  \n- **OpenTelemetry**: Observability and tracing across agent boundaries\n- **Coordination**: Multi-agent workflow patterns and IF-THEN rules\n- **Error Contracts**: Consistent error handling with recoverability\n- **Subprocess Delegation**: How orchestrators invoke and manage sub-agents\n\n## What Makes Me Different\n\nWhile other agents handle their specific domains, **I handle the system itself**. When you need an agent built, I build it. When you need agents to work together, I create the orchestration layer. When you have an existing project that needs to become agent-aware, I apply the standards to make it interoperable.\n\n## How I Work\n\nI'm a \"shared\" agent - designed to work anywhere, not tied to any specific system. I can:\n\n- Create agents from scratch following A2A protocol standards\n- Scaffold complete multi-agent systems with proper orchestration\n- Help existing projects adopt agent standards incrementally  \n- Debug agent coordination and delegation issues\n- Evolve the standards themselves when patterns emerge\n\nWhat would you like me to help you build today? An agent for a specific domain? A complete agent system? Or bring an existing project up to agent standards?"
